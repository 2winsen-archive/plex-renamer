# plex-renamer
Helpers to rename files per Plex conventions

`rename-files-as-directories.js`
Used to rename movies files and subtitle files similar way as directories by Plex conventions
BY default helper runs in dry mode (no action is done, olny logs how renames will look like), to actually make renames add -f flag,
